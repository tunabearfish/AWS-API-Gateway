For this example: we will build a REST API

### 3. Create a New API

  Give your API a name and description
  Choose Endpoint Type. For public access, Select "Regional" for private access within your VPC, choose "Private"
  Click Create API 

  For this example: I will call my API -"MyFirstAPI" and I will choose Endpoint Type "Regional"

### 4. Create Methods

In the API Gateway console, you'll see a tree-like structure. Create resources that represent the URL paths of your API.
For each resource, create HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to define what actions are allowed on that resource

Click on Actions and for this example we will use GET
